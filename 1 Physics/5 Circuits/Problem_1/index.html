<h2 id="1-understanding-the-circuit-to-graph-representation">1. Understanding the Circuit-to-Graph Representation</h2>
<p>The analysis of electrical circuits, particularly for calculating equivalent resistance, is a cornerstone of electrical engineering. Traditional methods rely on iterative applications of series and parallel resistor formulas, which can become computationally intensive for complex networks. Graph theory provides a robust and systematic framework to model and simplify such circuits, enabling both analytical insights and computational efficiency. This section explores how to represent an electrical circuit as a graph, emphasizing the mapping of circuit components to graph elements and the underlying graph-theoretic concepts.</p>
<h3 id="11-circuit-to-graph-mapping">1.1 Circuit-to-Graph Mapping</h3>
<p>An electrical circuit can be modeled as a <strong>weighted undirected graph</strong> <span class="arithmatex">\(G = (V, E, w)\)</span>, where:
- <strong>Nodes (<span class="arithmatex">\(V\)</span>)</strong>: Represent junctions or connection points in the circuit where two or more circuit elements (e.g., resistors, wires) meet. These are points of equal potential (equipotential points) in the circuit.
- <strong>Edges (<span class="arithmatex">\(E\)</span>)</strong>: Represent resistors connecting pairs of junctions. Each edge corresponds to a resistor bridging two nodes.
- <strong>Weights (<span class="arithmatex">\(w : E \to \mathbb{R}^+\)</span>)</strong>: Represent the resistance values of the resistors, typically measured in ohms (<span class="arithmatex">\(\Omega\)</span>). For an edge <span class="arithmatex">\(e \in E\)</span> connecting nodes <span class="arithmatex">\(u, v \in V\)</span>, the weight <span class="arithmatex">\(w(e) = R_{uv}\)</span> is the resistance of the resistor.</p>
<p>Formally, let <span class="arithmatex">\(V = \{ v_1, v_2, \dots, v_n \}\)</span> denote the set of nodes (junctions), and <span class="arithmatex">\(E = \{ e_1, e_2, \dots, e_m \}\)</span> denote the set of edges (resistors). The graph <span class="arithmatex">\(G\)</span> is undirected because resistors have no directional preference, and the weight function <span class="arithmatex">\(w(e_i) = R_i\)</span> assigns a positive real number to each edge, reflecting the resistance.</p>
<h4 id="example-simple-series-circuit">Example: Simple Series Circuit</h4>
<p>Consider a circuit with three resistors in series: <span class="arithmatex">\(R_1 = 2\Omega\)</span>, <span class="arithmatex">\(R_2 = 3\Omega\)</span>, <span class="arithmatex">\(R_3 = 4\Omega\)</span>. The circuit can be represented as a graph with:
- Nodes: <span class="arithmatex">\(v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4\)</span> (junctions between resistors and at the terminals).
- Edges: <span class="arithmatex">\(e_1 = (v_1, v_2)\)</span> with <span class="arithmatex">\(w(e_1) = 2\Omega\)</span>, <span class="arithmatex">\(e_2 = (v_2, v_3)\)</span> with <span class="arithmatex">\(w(e_2) = 3\Omega\)</span>, <span class="arithmatex">\(e_3 = (v_3, v_4)\)</span> with <span class="arithmatex">\(w(e_3) = 4\Omega\)</span>.
- Graph structure: A linear path <span class="arithmatex">\(v_1 \to v_2 \to v_3 \to v_4\)</span>.</p>
<p>The equivalent resistance <span class="arithmatex">\(R_{\text{eq}}\)</span> is computed as:
<span class="arithmatex">\(<span class="arithmatex">\(R_{\text{eq}} = R_1 + R_2 + R_3 = 2 + 3 + 4 = 9\Omega\)</span>\)</span></p>
<p>This linear graph reflects the series configuration, where the total resistance is the sum of individual resistances.</p>
<h4 id="example-simple-parallel-circuit">Example: Simple Parallel Circuit</h4>
<p>For two resistors in parallel, <span class="arithmatex">\(R_1 = 4\Omega\)</span>, <span class="arithmatex">\(R_2 = 4\Omega\)</span>, connected between two junctions:
- Nodes: <span class="arithmatex">\(v_1, v_2\)</span> (the two junctions).
- Edges: <span class="arithmatex">\(e_1 = (v_1, v_2)\)</span> with <span class="arithmatex">\(w(e_1) = 4\Omega\)</span>, <span class="arithmatex">\(e_2 = (v_1, v_2)\)</span> with <span class="arithmatex">\(w(e_2) = 4\Omega\)</span>.
- Graph structure: Two parallel edges between <span class="arithmatex">\(v_1\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(v_2\)</span>.</p>
<p>The equivalent resistance is given by the parallel resistance formula:
<span class="arithmatex">\(<span class="arithmatex">\(\frac{1}{R_{\text{eq}}} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2}\)</span>\)</span>
<span class="arithmatex">\(<span class="arithmatex">\(R_{\text{eq}} = 2\Omega\)</span>\)</span></p>
<p>This graph representation captures the parallel configuration, where multiple edges between the same node pair indicate resistors in parallel.</p>
<h3 id="12-graph-theory-concepts-for-circuit-analysis">1.2 Graph Theory Concepts for Circuit Analysis</h3>
<p>To effectively model and analyze circuits as graphs, a solid understanding of fundamental graph theory concepts is essential. These concepts provide the mathematical foundation for identifying series and parallel connections and simplifying complex networks.</p>
<h4 id="121-nodes-and-degree">1.2.1 Nodes and Degree</h4>
<p>The <strong>degree</strong> of a node <span class="arithmatex">\(v \in V\)</span>, denoted <span class="arithmatex">\(\deg(v)\)</span>, is the number of edges incident to it. In a circuit graph:
- A node with <span class="arithmatex">\(\deg(v) = 2\)</span> typically indicates a junction between two resistors in series, as it connects exactly two resistors (e.g., <span class="arithmatex">\(v_2\)</span> in the series example above).
- A node with <span class="arithmatex">\(\deg(v) &gt; 2\)</span> may indicate a junction where multiple resistors converge, potentially forming parallel or more complex configurations.</p>
<p>For a graph with <span class="arithmatex">\(n\)</span> nodes and <span class="arithmatex">\(m\)</span> edges, the sum of degrees satisfies the handshaking lemma:
<span class="arithmatex">\(<span class="arithmatex">\(\sum_{v \in V} \deg(v) = 2m\)</span>\)</span></p>
<p>This property ensures consistency in the circuit’s connectivity.</p>
<h4 id="122-edges-and-weights">1.2.2 Edges and Weights</h4>
<p>Edges in the circuit graph are weighted by resistance values. For an edge <span class="arithmatex">\(e = (u, v)\)</span>, the weight <span class="arithmatex">\(w(e) = R_{uv}\)</span> is a positive real number. The weight function is critical for computations, as it directly influences the equivalent resistance. For parallel edges between nodes <span class="arithmatex">\(u\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(v\)</span>, say <span class="arithmatex">\(e_1, e_2\)</span> with weights <span class="arithmatex">\(R_1, R_2\)</span>, the equivalent resistance is:
<span class="arithmatex">\(<span class="arithmatex">\(R_{\text{eq}} = \left( \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} \right)^{-1}\)</span>\)</span></p>
<p>This formula generalizes to <span class="arithmatex">\(k\)</span> parallel edges:
<span class="arithmatex">\(<span class="arithmatex">\(\frac{1}{R_{\text{eq}}} = \sum_{i=1}^k \frac{1}{R_i}\)</span>\)</span></p>
<h4 id="123-cycles">1.2.3 Cycles</h4>
<p>A <strong>cycle</strong> in a graph is a closed path where the starting and ending nodes are the same, and no edges are repeated. In circuit graphs, cycles often indicate parallel or more complex configurations. For example:
- A cycle of length 2 (two edges between the same pair of nodes) represents parallel resistors.
- Longer cycles may indicate configurations like Wheatstone bridges or delta-star transformations, which require advanced simplification techniques.</p>
<p>The presence of cycles can be detected using graph traversal algorithms like <strong>depth-first search (DFS)</strong>, which explores the graph to identify closed paths. The cycle structure informs the reduction strategy, as parallel resistors form the simplest type of cycle.</p>
<h4 id="124-connectivity-and-paths">1.2.4 Connectivity and Paths</h4>
<p>A graph is <strong>connected</strong> if there is a path between any pair of nodes. In circuit analysis, we assume the circuit graph is connected, as disconnected components would represent separate circuits. A <strong>path</strong> between nodes <span class="arithmatex">\(u\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(v\)</span> is a sequence of edges connecting them. For series configurations, the path is unique and linear, with intermediate nodes of degree 2. The resistance along a path in series is:
<span class="arithmatex">\(<span class="arithmatex">\(R_{\text{path}} = \sum_{e \in \text{path}} w(e)\)</span>\)</span></p>
<h4 id="125-adjacency-and-incidence">1.2.5 Adjacency and Incidence</h4>
<p>The <strong>adjacency matrix</strong> <span class="arithmatex">\(A\)</span> of a graph encodes connectivity: <span class="arithmatex">\(A_{ij} = 1\)</span> if an edge exists between nodes <span class="arithmatex">\(v_i\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(v_j\)</span>, and 0 otherwise. For weighted graphs, a <strong>weighted adjacency matrix</strong> can store resistance values: <span class="arithmatex">\(A_{ij} = R_{ij}\)</span> if an edge exists, else <span class="arithmatex">\(\infty\)</span>. The <strong>incidence matrix</strong> <span class="arithmatex">\(B\)</span> relates nodes to edges: <span class="arithmatex">\(B_{ve} = 1\)</span> if node <span class="arithmatex">\(v\)</span> is an endpoint of edge <span class="arithmatex">\(e\)</span>, and 0 otherwise. These matrices are useful for computational implementations and advanced analyses (e.g., Kirchhoff’s laws).</p>
<h3 id="13-representing-series-and-parallel-connections">1.3 Representing Series and Parallel Connections</h3>
<p>The graph representation naturally captures series and parallel resistor configurations, which are the building blocks of circuit simplification.</p>
<h4 id="131-series-connections">1.3.1 Series Connections</h4>
<p>A series connection occurs when resistors are arranged along a single path with no branching. In graph terms:
- The subgraph is a path where intermediate nodes have <span class="arithmatex">\(\deg(v) = 2\)</span>.
- For resistors <span class="arithmatex">\(R_1, R_2, \dots, R_k\)</span> in series, the equivalent resistance is:
<span class="arithmatex">\(<span class="arithmatex">\(R_{\text{eq}} = R_1 + R_2 + \cdots + R_k = \sum_{i=1}^k R_i\)</span>\)</span>
- Graphically, the path <span class="arithmatex">\(v_1 \to v_2 \to \cdots \to v_{k+1}\)</span> with edges <span class="arithmatex">\(e_i = (v_i, v_{i+1})\)</span> of weights <span class="arithmatex">\(R_i\)</span> is reduced to a single edge <span class="arithmatex">\((v_1, v_{k+1})\)</span> with weight <span class="arithmatex">\(R_{\text{eq}}\)</span>.</p>
<h4 id="132-parallel-connections">1.3.2 Parallel Connections</h4>
<p>A parallel connection occurs when multiple resistors connect the same pair of nodes. In graph terms:
- Multiple edges exist between nodes <span class="arithmatex">\(u\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(v\)</span>.
- For resistors <span class="arithmatex">\(R_1, R_2, \dots, R_k\)</span> in parallel, the equivalent resistance is:
<span class="arithmatex">\(<span class="arithmatex">\(R_{\text{eq}} = \left( \sum_{i=1}^k \frac{1}{R_i} \right)^{-1}\)</span>\)</span>
- Graphically, the multiple edges <span class="arithmatex">\(e_1, e_2, \dots, e_k\)</span> between <span class="arithmatex">\(u\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(v\)</span> are replaced by a single edge with weight <span class="arithmatex">\(R_{\text{eq}}\)</span>.</p>
<h4 id="133-nested-configurations">1.3.3 Nested Configurations</h4>
<p>Complex circuits often involve nested series and parallel combinations. The graph representation handles these by iteratively identifying and reducing series and parallel subgraphs. For example, consider a circuit where two resistors <span class="arithmatex">\(R_1, R_2\)</span> are in series, and their combination is in parallel with <span class="arithmatex">\(R_3\)</span>:
- First, reduce the series combination:
<span class="arithmatex">\(<span class="arithmatex">\(R_{12} = R_1 + R_2\)</span>\)</span>
- Then, compute the parallel combination with <span class="arithmatex">\(R_3\)</span>:
<span class="arithmatex">\(<span class="arithmatex">\(R_{\text{eq}} = \left( \frac{1}{R_{12}} + \frac{1}{R_3} \right)^{-1} = \left( \frac{1}{R_1 + R_2} + \frac{1}{R_3} \right)^{-1}\)</span>\)</span></p>
<p>This iterative process leverages the graph structure to systematically simplify the network.</p>
<h3 id="14-practical-considerations">1.4 Practical Considerations</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Graph Simplification</strong>: The goal is to reduce the graph to a single edge between the input and output nodes, with the edge weight equal to <span class="arithmatex">\(R_{\text{eq}}\)</span>. This requires careful identification of series and parallel patterns using traversal algorithms.</li>
<li><strong>Complex Configurations</strong>: Circuits with cycles (e.g., bridges or delta configurations) may require advanced techniques like <strong>star-delta transformations</strong>:
<span class="arithmatex">\(<span class="arithmatex">\(R_{\text{delta}} \to R_{\text{star}}: \quad R_i = \frac{R_a R_b}{R_a + R_b + R_c}\)</span>\)</span>
where <span class="arithmatex">\(R_a, R_b, R_c\)</span> are the resistances in a delta configuration.</li>
<li><strong>Computational Tools</strong>: Libraries like NetworkX (Python) can represent and manipulate weighted graphs, facilitating the identification of series and parallel subgraphs.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="15-summary">1.5 Summary</h3>
<p>Modeling an electrical circuit as a weighted undirected graph provides a powerful framework for analyzing equivalent resistance. Nodes represent junctions, edges represent resistors with weights as resistance values, and graph theory concepts like degree, cycles, and paths enable the identification of series and parallel configurations. The mathematical formalism, supported by equations like:
<span class="arithmatex">\(<span class="arithmatex">\(R_{\text{series}} = \sum R_i, \quad R_{\text{parallel}} = \left( \sum \frac{1}{R_i} \right)^{-1}\)</span>\)</span>
ensures precise computation. This approach not only streamlines manual analysis but also supports automated circuit simulation, making it invaluable for engineering and computational applications.</p>

<h1 id="algorithm-development-for-calculating-equivalent-resistance-using-graph-theory">Algorithm Development for Calculating Equivalent Resistance Using Graph Theory</h1>
<h2 id="2-developing-the-algorithm-for-equivalent-resistance">2. Developing the Algorithm for Equivalent Resistance</h2>
<p>Calculating the equivalent resistance of an electrical circuit is a fundamental task in circuit analysis, traditionally approached through iterative application of series and parallel resistor formulas. For complex circuits, these methods can become cumbersome, especially when dealing with nested configurations. By modeling a circuit as a weighted undirected graph <span class="arithmatex">\(G = (V, E, w)\)</span>, where nodes represent junctions, edges represent resistors, and weights denote resistance values, graph theory offers a systematic and algorithmic approach to simplify the circuit and compute the equivalent resistance <span class="arithmatex">\(R_{\text{eq}}\)</span>. This section outlines the development of an algorithm that iteratively simplifies the graph by identifying and reducing series and parallel connections, ensuring robust handling of nested combinations.</p>
<h3 id="21-overview-of-the-algorithm">2.1 Overview of the Algorithm</h3>
<p>The algorithm iteratively reduces the graph <span class="arithmatex">\(G\)</span> until it consists of a single edge between the input and output nodes, with the edge’s weight equal to the equivalent resistance <span class="arithmatex">\(R_{\text{eq}}\)</span>. The process involves:
- <strong>Identifying Series Connections</strong>: Detect linear chains of edges (resistors) forming a path with no branching, and combine their resistances by summation.
- <strong>Identifying Parallel Connections</strong>: Detect multiple edges between the same pair of nodes, and combine their resistances using the parallel resistance formula.
- <strong>Iterative Reduction</strong>: Repeatedly apply series and parallel reductions until the graph is fully simplified.
- <strong>Handling Nested Combinations</strong>: Ensure the algorithm processes complex configurations (e.g., series within parallel or vice versa) by iteratively simplifying identifiable patterns.</p>

<p>A series connection occurs when resistors form a linear chain with no branching paths, corresponding to a path in the graph where intermediate nodes have degree 2. Formally, consider a path <span class="arithmatex">\(v_1 \to v_2 \to \cdots \to v_{k+1}\)</span> with edges <span class="arithmatex">\(e_i = (v_i, v_{i+1})\)</span> and resistances <span class="arithmatex">\(R_i = w(e_i)\)</span> for <span class="arithmatex">\(i = 1, 2, \dots, k\)</span>, where each intermediate node <span class="arithmatex">\(v_2, v_3, \dots, v_k\)</span> has <span class="arithmatex">\(\deg(v_i) = 2\)</span>. The equivalent resistance of the series combination is:
<span class="arithmatex">\(<span class="arithmatex">\(R_{\text{series}} = R_1 + R_2 + \cdots + R_k = \sum_{i=1}^k R_i\)</span>\)</span></p>
<p>To identify series connections:
- Traverse the graph to find nodes with <span class="arithmatex">\(\deg(v) = 2\)</span>.
- For each such node <span class="arithmatex">\(v_i\)</span> with neighbors <span class="arithmatex">\(v_{i-1}\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(v_{i+1}\)</span>, combine the edges <span class="arithmatex">\((v_{i-1}, v_i)\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\((v_i, v_{i+1})\)</span> into a single edge <span class="arithmatex">\((v_{i-1}, v_{i+1})\)</span> with weight <span class="arithmatex">\(R_{i-1} + R_i\)</span>.
- Remove node <span class="arithmatex">\(v_i\)</span> and update the graph.</p>
<p>This reduction preserves the equivalent resistance between the remaining nodes.</p>

2. Combines the new edge with <span class="arithmatex">\(R_3\)</span> at <span class="arithmatex">\(v_3\)</span>, resulting in a single edge <span class="arithmatex">\((v_1, v_4)\)</span> with resistance <span class="arithmatex">\(5 + 4 = 9\Omega\)</span>.
The equivalent resistance is:

<h3 id="23-identifying-parallel-connections">2.3 Identifying Parallel Connections</h3>
<p>A parallel connection occurs when multiple resistors connect the same pair of nodes, represented by multiple edges between two nodes in the graph.

<p>To identify parallel connections:
- Examine all pairs of nodes <span class="arithmatex">\((u, v)\)</span> to detect multiple edges.

<p>The algorithm iteratively applies series and parallel reductions until the graph is reduced to a single edge between the input and output nodes, representing <span class="arithmatex">\(R_{\text{eq}}\)</span>. The process is as follows:
1. <strong>Check for Series Connections</strong>: Identify and reduce all nodes with <span class="arithmatex">\(\deg(v) = 2\)</span> by combining adjacent edges.
2. <strong>Check for Parallel Connections</strong>: Identify and reduce all node pairs with multiple edges using the parallel formula.
3. <strong>Repeat</strong>: Continue alternating between series and parallel reductions until no further reductions are possible.
4. <strong>Termination</strong>: The algorithm terminates when the graph has a single edge between the input and output nodes, with weight <span class="arithmatex">\(R_{\text{eq}}\)</span>. If the graph cannot be reduced to a single edge (e.g., due to complex configurations like bridges), report an error or apply advanced techniques (e.g., star-delta transformations).</p>
<p>The iterative nature ensures that nested combinations—such as series resistors within a parallel configuration—are handled by processing identifiable patterns in each iteration.</p>

<p>The computation of equivalent resistance <span class="arithmatex">\(R_{\text{eq}}\)</span> in an electrical circuit modeled as a weighted undirected graph <span class="arithmatex">\(G = (V, E, w)\)</span> requires a systematic approach to simplify the graph through iterative series and parallel reductions. The pseudocode presented here formalizes the algorithm, providing a clear and structured outline of the steps to identify series and parallel connections, reduce the graph, and handle nested configurations. This section explains the pseudocode, its operational logic, and how it addresses complex circuit structures, ensuring robustness and clarity for both theoretical understanding and practical implementation.</p>
<h3 id="31-pseudocode-overview">3.1 Pseudocode Overview</h3>
<p>The pseudocode operates on a graph <span class="arithmatex">\(G\)</span> where nodes represent junctions, edges represent resistors, and weights represent resistance values in ohms (<span class="arithmatex">\(\Omega\)</span>). The algorithm iteratively applies two primary operations:
- <strong>Series Reduction</strong>: Combines resistors along a linear path (nodes with degree 2) by summing their resistances.
- <strong>Parallel Reduction</strong>: Combines multiple resistors between the same pair of nodes using the parallel resistance formula.
The process continues until the graph is reduced to a single edge between the input and output nodes, with the edge’s weight equal to <span class="arithmatex">\(R_{\text{eq}}\)</span>. The pseudocode includes error handling for cases where the graph cannot be reduced to a single edge (e.g., non-series-parallel configurations).</p>
<p>The pseudocode is designed to be language-agnostic, focusing on logical steps that can be implemented in any programming environment.

<h4 id="analysis_2">Analysis</h4>
<p>The nested configuration requires two iterations: first a series reduction to combine <span class="arithmatex">\(R_1\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(R_2\)</span>, then a parallel reduction to combine the series result with <span class="arithmatex">\(R_3\)</span>. The algorithm’s iterative approach ensures that the nested structure is handled by processing the series subgraph first, creating a simpler parallel configuration that can be reduced in the next step. This example highlights the algorithm’s ability to systematically simplify complex circuits.</p>
<h3 id="45-iterative-reductions-for-nested-structures">4.5 Iterative Reductions for Nested Structures</h3>
<p>The algorithm’s strength lies in its iterative reduction strategy, which naturally handles nested configurations by:
- <strong>Pattern Recognition</strong>: Identifying series (degree-2 nodes) and parallel (multiple edges) subgraphs in each iteration.
- <strong>Step-by-Step Simplification</strong>: Reducing simpler subgraphs first, which may create new series or parallel opportunities in subsequent iterations.
- <strong>Flexibility</strong>: Alternating between series and parallel reductions as needed, ensuring that nested structures are unraveled progressively.</p>
<p>For the nested example, the series reduction of <span class="arithmatex">\(R_1\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(R_2\)</span> transforms the graph into a parallel configuration, which is then reduced in the next iteration. This process generalizes to more complex circuits, such as multiple nested layers, because any series-parallel circuit can be reduced to a single equivalent resistance through repeated application of these rules. Mathematically, the algorithm leverages the commutative and associative properties of series and parallel operations, ensuring correctness regardless of the order of reductions.</p>
<h3 id="46-limitations-and-extensions">4.6 Limitations and Extensions</h3>
<p>While the algorithm excels for series-parallel circuits, it may encounter limitations with:
- <strong>Non-Series-Parallel Configurations</strong>: Circuits like Wheatstone bridges or delta configurations require advanced techniques, such as star-delta transformations:
<span class="arithmatex">\(<span class="arithmatex">\(R_{\text{star}} = \frac{R_a R_b}{R_a + R_b + R_c}\)</span>\)</span>
- <strong>Complex Nested Structures</strong>: Deeply nested circuits may require multiple iterations, increasing computational time for large graphs.</p>
<p>To extend the algorithm, one could:
- Incorporate star-delta transformations for non-series-parallel circuits.
- Optimize iteration order (e.g., prioritize series reductions) to reduce the number of steps.
- Use efficient graph traversal algorithms (e.g., depth-first search) to identify reducible subgraphs quickly.</p>
<h3 id="47-summary">4.7 Summary</h3>
<p>The graph-theoretic algorithm effectively handles complex circuit configurations by iteratively applying series and parallel reductions, as demonstrated in three examples:
- <strong>Simple Series Circuit</strong>: Identifies a linear chain and computes <span class="arithmatex">\(R_{\text{eq}} = 5\Omega\)</span> in one iteration.
- <strong>Simple Parallel Circuit</strong>: Identifies multiple edges and computes <span class="arithmatex">\(R_{\text{eq}} = 2\Omega\)</span> in one iteration.
- <strong>Nested Configuration</strong>: Processes a series-parallel structure in two iterations, computing <span class="arithmatex">\(R_{\text{eq}} = 2.5\Omega\)</span>.</p>
<p>The iterative reduction strategy, supported by equations like:
<span class="arithmatex">\(<span class="arithmatex">\(R_{\text{series}} = \sum_{i=1}^k R_i, \quad R_{\text{parallel}} = \left( \sum_{i=1}^k \frac{1}{R_i} \right)^{-1}\)</span>\)</span>
ensures that nested structures are simplified step-by-step, making the algorithm a powerful tool for circuit analysis. Its ability to handle complex configurations through systematic subgraph reduction underscores its utility in both theoretical and practical applications.</p>

<h2 id="7-conclusion">7. Conclusion</h2>
<p>The graph-theoretic approach to simplifying electrical circuits provides a systematic and mathematically rigorous method for calculating equivalent resistance, as demonstrated through Case 1 and additional examples. By modeling circuits as graphs and applying iterative series and parallel reductions, we transform complex networks into a single equivalent resistance, such as <span class="arithmatex">\(R_{eq} = 21\Omega\)</span> for the series circuit in Case 1. The algorithm, with its ability to handle nested combinations through iterative simplification, proves versatile across configurations, yielding <span class="arithmatex">\(R_{eq} = 9\Omega\)</span> for a simple series circuit, <span class="arithmatex">\(R_{eq} = 2\Omega\)</span> for a parallel circuit, and <span class="arithmatex">\(R_{eq} = 7\Omega\)</span> for a nested series-parallel circuit. Despite a time complexity of <span class="arithmatex">\(O((|V| + |E|)^2)\)</span>, potential enhancements like DFS-based pattern detection and delta-star transformations could reduce this to <span class="arithmatex">\(O(|V| + |E|)\)</span> per reduction, making the method highly efficient for large-scale circuit analysis. This framework not only deepens our understanding of circuit behavior but also lays the groundwork for advanced applications in electrical engineering, such as optimizing circuit design and analyzing power distribution networks.</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[ R_{eq} = R_1 + R_2 \quad \text{(Series Combination)} \]</div>
<div class="arithmatex">\[ R_{eq} = \frac{R_1 \cdot R_2}{R_1 + R_2} \quad \text{(Parallel Combination)} \]</div>
<div class="arithmatex">\[ R_{star} = \frac{R_{delta}^2}{\sum R_{delta}} \quad \text{(Delta-Star Transformation)} \]</div>
