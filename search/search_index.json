This section establishes the theoretical framework by deriving the equations of motion from first principles, decomposing initial conditions, and solving the resulting differential equations. We assume an idealized scenario with no air resistance and constant gravitational acceleration, providing a baseline for analyzing the range as a function of the angle of projection. Newton\u2019s Second Law Applied to Projectile Motion Newton\u2019s second law, \\(\\vec{F} = m\\vec{a}\\) , describes the motion of a projectile under gravity. For a projectile of mass \\(m\\) , the only force acting is gravity, directed vertically downward. We define a Cartesian coordinate system where \\(x\\) is horizontal (positive to the right) and \\(y\\) is vertical (positive upward). The gravitational force is: \\[ \\vec{F} = -mg\\hat{j} \\] where \\(g\\) is the gravitational acceleration ( \\(g \\approx 9.81 \\, \\text{m/s}^2\\) ) and \\(\\hat{j}\\) is the unit vector in the \\(y\\) -direction. Since no forces act horizontally (in the absence of air resistance), the net force components are: \\[ F_x = 0, \\quad F_y = -mg \\] Applying Newton\u2019s second law in each direction: \\[ m \\frac{d^2 x}{dt^2} = 0, \\quad m \\frac{d^2 y}{dt^2} = -mg \\] Simplifying by dividing through by \\(m\\) (assuming \\(m \\neq 0\\) ): \\[ \\frac{d^2 x}{dt^2} = 0, \\quad \\frac{d^2 y}{dt^2} = -g \\] These second-order differential equations govern the projectile\u2019s motion in two dimensions. Decomposition of Initial Velocity The projectile is launched with an initial speed \\(v_0\\) at an angle \\(\\theta\\) to the horizontal. Using trigonometry, the initial velocity vector \\(\\vec{v}_0\\) is resolved into horizontal and vertical components: \\[ v_{0x} = v_0 \\cos\\theta, \\quad v_{0y} = v_0 \\sin\\theta \\] At \\(t = 0\\) , assuming the launch point is at the origin \\((x_0, y_0) = (0, 0)\\) , the initial conditions are: \\[ x(0) = 0, \\quad y(0) = 0, \\quad \\frac{dx}{dt}(0) = v_0 \\cos\\theta, \\quad \\frac{dy}{dt}(0) = v_0 \\sin\\theta \\] These components dictate the projectile\u2019s trajectory, with \\(v_{0x}\\) driving horizontal motion and \\(v_{0y}\\) opposing gravity in the vertical direction. Differential Equations of Motion The equations \\(\\frac{d^2 x}{dt^2} = 0\\) and \\(\\frac{d^2 y}{dt^2} = -g\\) are solved independently due to the decoupling of horizontal and vertical motion. Horizontal Motion For the \\(x\\) -direction: \\[ \\frac{d^2 x}{dt^2} = 0 \\] Integrate with respect to time: \\[ \\frac{dx}{dt} = \\int 0 \\, dt = C_1 \\] where \\(C_1\\) is a constant. Using the initial condition \\(\\frac{dx}{dt}(0) = v_0 \\cos\\theta\\) : \\[ \\frac{dx}{dt} = v_0 \\cos\\theta \\] Integrate again: \\[ x(t) = \\int (v_0 \\cos\\theta) \\, dt = v_0 \\cos\\theta \\cdot t + C_2 \\] With \\(x(0) = 0\\) : \\[ x(0) = 0 = v_0 \\cos\\theta \\cdot 0 + C_2 \\implies C_2 = 0 \\] Thus: \\[ x(t) = v_0 \\cos\\theta \\cdot t \\] Vertical Motion For the \\(y\\) -direction: \\[ \\frac{d^2 y}{dt^2} = -g \\] Integrate: \\[ \\frac{dy}{dt} = \\int -g \\, dt = -gt + C_3 \\] Using \\(\\frac{dy}{dt}(0) = v_0 \\sin\\theta\\) : \\[ v_0 \\sin\\theta = -g \\cdot 0 + C_3 \\implies C_3 = v_0 \\sin\\theta \\] So: \\[ \\frac{dy}{dt} = v_0 \\sin\\theta - gt \\] Integrate again: \\[ y(t) = \\int (v_0 \\sin\\theta - gt) \\, dt = v_0 \\sin\\theta \\cdot t - \\frac{1}{2} g t^2 + C_4 \\] With \\(y(0) = 0\\) : \\[ y(0) = 0 = v_0 \\sin\\theta \\cdot 0 - \\frac{1}{2} g \\cdot 0^2 + C_4 \\implies C_4 = 0 \\] Thus: \\[ y(t) = v_0 \\sin\\theta \\cdot t - \\frac{1}{2} g t^2 \\] General Solution The position of the projectile as a function of time is: \\[ x(t) = v_0 \\cos\\theta \\cdot t, \\quad y(t) = v_0 \\sin\\theta \\cdot t - \\frac{1}{2} g t^2 \\] This parametric form describes a parabolic trajectory, with \\(x(t)\\) linear and \\(y(t)\\) quadratic in time. Key Variables and Parametric Dependence The equations depend on several parameters: - Initial velocity ( \\(v_0\\) ) : Scales both \\(x(t)\\) and \\(y(t)\\) linearly, increasing the range and height. - Angle of projection ( \\(\\theta\\) ) : Modulates the balance between horizontal and vertical components via \\(\\cos\\theta\\) and \\(\\sin\\theta\\) . - Gravitational acceleration ( \\(g\\) ) : Affects only the vertical motion, steepening the parabola as \\(g\\) increases. - Initial height ( \\(h\\) ) : If \\(y(0) = h \\neq 0\\) , the vertical equation becomes: \\[ y(t) = h + v_0 \\sin\\theta \\cdot t - \\frac{1}{2} g t^2 \\] Sensitivity Analysis Increasing \\(v_0\\) amplifies the range and maximum height proportionally to \\(v_0^2\\) (as derived later for range). Varying \\(\\theta\\) shifts energy between horizontal and vertical motion, with \\(\\theta = 45^\\circ\\) often maximizing range (to be verified). Larger \\(g\\) reduces flight time and range, compressing the trajectory. Non-zero \\(h\\) extends flight time and alters the range, requiring a modified time-of-flight calculation. Discussion These equations form a family of solutions parameterized by \\(v_0\\) , \\(\\theta\\) , \\(g\\) , and \\(h\\) . The horizontal range, defined as \\(x(t)\\) when \\(y(t) = 0\\) , depends critically on \\(\\theta\\) , setting the stage for further analysis. This idealized model assumes no air resistance, a simplification to be revisited when considering real-world applications. References Goldstein, H., Poole, C., & Safko, J. (2002).

Analysis of the Range in Projectile Motion Introduction The horizontal range of a projectile\u2014the distance traveled along the ground before landing\u2014is a key metric in understanding how launch parameters influence its trajectory. This section derives the range formula for a projectile launched from ground level, explores its dependence on the angle of projection, and examines the effects of varying initial velocity and gravitational acceleration. We aim to predict range behavior across a spectrum of angles and hypothesize the optimal angle for maximum range. Derivation of the Range Formula For a projectile launched from ground level ( \\(y_0 = 0\\) ), the range \\(R\\) is the horizontal distance \\(x(t)\\) when the projectile returns to \\(y = 0\\) . From the theoretical foundation, the position equations are: \\[ x(t) = v_0 \\cos\\theta \\cdot t, \\quad y(t) = v_0 \\sin\\theta \\cdot t - \\frac{1}{2} g t^2 \\] where \\(v_0\\) is the initial velocity, \\(\\theta\\) is the angle of projection, \\(g\\) is gravitational acceleration, and \\(t\\) is time. Time of Flight The projectile lands when \\(y(t) = 0\\) . Set the vertical position to zero: \\[ v_0 \\sin\\theta \\cdot t - \\frac{1}{2} g t^2 = 0 \\] Factorize: \\[ t \\left( v_0 \\sin\\theta - \\frac{1}{2} g t \\right) = 0 \\] This yields two solutions: - \\(t = 0\\) (launch time), - \\(v_0 \\sin\\theta - \\frac{1}{2} g t = 0\\) . Solve the second: \\[ \\frac{1}{2} g t = v_0 \\sin\\theta \\implies t = \\frac{2 v_0 \\sin\\theta}{g} \\] This \\(t = \\frac{2 v_0 \\sin\\theta}{g}\\) is the time of flight, \\(T\\) , when the projectile returns to ground level. Horizontal Range Substitute \\(T\\) into the horizontal position equation: \\[ R = x(T) = v_0 \\cos\\theta \\cdot T = v_0 \\cos\\theta \\cdot \\frac{2 v_0 \\sin\\theta}{g} \\] Simplify using the trigonometric identity \\(2 \\sin\\theta \\cos\\theta = \\sin 2\\theta\\) : \\[ R = \\frac{v_0^2 2 \\sin\\theta \\cos\\theta}{g} = \\frac{v_0^2 \\sin 2\\theta}{g} \\] Thus, the range formula is: \\[ R = \\frac{v_0^2 \\sin 2\\theta}{g} \\] This equation expresses \\(R\\) as a function of \\(\\theta\\) , \\(v_0\\) , and \\(g\\) , valid for a projectile launched and landing at the same height. Testing Projection Angles To explore how \\(R\\) varies with \\(\\theta\\) , consider angles from \\(0^\\circ\\) to \\(90^\\circ\\) : - At \\(\\theta = 0^\\circ\\) : \\(\\sin 2\\theta = \\sin 0^\\circ = 0\\) , so \\(R = 0\\) (no horizontal motion). - At \\(\\theta = 30^\\circ\\) : \\(\\sin 2\\theta = \\sin 60^\\circ = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\) , so \\(R = \\frac{v_0^2 \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}}{g}\\) . - At \\(\\theta = 45^\\circ\\) : \\(\\sin 2\\theta = \\sin 90^\\circ = 1\\) , so \\(R = \\frac{v_0^2}{g}\\) (potential maximum). - At \\(\\theta = 60^\\circ\\) : \\(\\sin 2\\theta = \\sin 120^\\circ = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\) , so \\(R = \\frac{v_0^2 \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}}{g}\\) (same as \\(30^\\circ\\) ). - At \\(\\theta = 90^\\circ\\) : \\(\\sin 2\\theta = \\sin 180^\\circ = 0\\) , so \\(R = 0\\) (straight up). The symmetry around \\(45^\\circ\\) (e.g., \\(30^\\circ\\) and \\(60^\\circ\\) yield equal ranges) suggests a parabolic dependence of \\(R\\) on \\(\\theta\\) , peaking at \\(\\sin 2\\theta = 1\\) . A planned test of angles in increments (e.g., \\(0^\\circ, 15^\\circ, 30^\\circ, 45^\\circ, 60^\\circ, 75^\\circ, 90^\\circ\\) ) will confirm this trend. Influence of Other Parameters The range depends on \\(v_0\\) and \\(g\\) alongside \\(\\theta\\) . Analyze their effects: - Initial Velocity ( \\(v_0\\) ) : \\(R \\propto v_0^2\\) . Doubling \\(v_0\\) quadruples \\(R\\) , as kinetic energy scales with \\(v_0^2\\) , extending both flight time and horizontal reach. - Gravitational Acceleration ( \\(g\\) ) : \\(R \\propto \\frac{1}{g}\\) . Increasing \\(g\\) reduces \\(R\\) by shortening the flight time, \\(T = \\frac{2 v_0 \\sin\\theta}{g}\\) , compressing the trajectory. Parametric Shifts Increasing \\(v_0\\) stretches the range curve upward, maintaining the peak at \\(\\theta = 45^\\circ\\) . Increasing \\(g\\) flattens the curve, reducing all ranges proportionally without altering the optimal angle. Combining changes (e.g., higher \\(v_0\\) , lower \\(g\\) ) amplifies \\(R\\) dramatically, useful for applications like artillery. Hypothesis for Maximum Range The term \\(\\sin 2\\theta\\) in \\(R = \\frac{v_0^2 \\sin 2\\theta}{g}\\) reaches its maximum of 1 when \\(2\\theta = 90^\\circ\\) , or \\(\\theta = 45^\\circ\\) . Thus, hypothesize that \\(\\theta = 45^\\circ\\) maximizes \\(R\\) . Physically, this balances horizontal velocity ( \\(v_0 \\cos\\theta\\) ) and flight time (proportional to \\(v_0 \\sin\\theta\\) ): - At \\(\\theta < 45^\\circ\\) , higher \\(v_{0x}\\) is offset by shorter \\(T\\) . - At \\(\\theta > 45^\\circ\\) , longer \\(T\\) is offset by lower \\(v_{0x}\\) . To test, compute the derivative of \\(R\\) with respect to \\(\\theta\\) : \\[ \\frac{dR}{d\\theta} = \\frac{d}{d\\theta} \\left( \\frac{v_0^2 \\sin 2\\theta}{g} \\right) = \\frac{v_0^2}{g} \\cdot 2 \\cos 2\\theta \\] Set \\(\\frac{dR}{d\\theta} = 0\\) : \\[ 2 \\cos 2\\theta = 0 \\implies \\cos 2\\theta = 0 \\implies 2\\theta = 90^\\circ \\implies \\theta = 45^\\circ \\] The second derivative, \\(\\frac{d^2 R}{d\\theta^2} = \\frac{v_0^2}{g} \\cdot (-4 \\sin 2\\theta)\\) , is negative at \\(\\theta = 45^\\circ\\) ( \\(\\sin 90^\\circ = 1\\) ), confirming a maximum. This supports the hypothesis that \\(45^\\circ\\) optimizes range due to the interplay of horizontal and vertical motion components. Discussion The range formula \\(R = \\frac{v_0^2 \\sin 2\\theta}{g}\\) encapsulates the projectile\u2019s dependence on \\(\\theta\\) , with a clear maximum at \\(45^\\circ\\) for ground-level launch and landing. Variations in \\(v_0\\) and \\(g\\) scale the range but preserve this optimum, highlighting the robustness of the result. Future analysis could explore non-zero launch heights, where symmetry breaks and the optimal angle shifts. References Goldstein, H., Poole, C., & Safko, J. (2002). Classical Mechanics . 3rd ed.
