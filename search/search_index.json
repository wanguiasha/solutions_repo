Theoretical Foundation Projectile motion involves both horizontal and vertical motion. The key equations governing projectile motion (without air resistance) are derived from basic kinematics. Horizontal Motion: \\[ x(t) = v_0 \\cdot \\cos(\\theta) \\cdot t \\] Vertical Motion: \\[ y(t) = v_0 \\cdot \\sin(\\theta) \\cdot t - \\frac{1}{2} g t^2 \\] Where: - \\( v_0 \\) is the initial velocity, - \\( \\theta \\) is the launch angle, - \\( g \\) is the gravitational acceleration (9.8 m/s\u00b2). Range of the Projectile: The range \\( R \\) is the horizontal distance traveled by the projectile when it reaches the ground. The time of flight \\( t_f \\) is given by: [ t_f = \\frac{2 v_0 \\sin(\\theta)}{g} ] Substituting this into the horizontal motion equation: [ R(\\theta) = \\frac{v_0^2 \\sin(2\\theta)}{g} ] The range depends on the angle \\( \\theta \\) and reaches its maximum at \\( \\theta = 45^\\circ \\) . 2. Analysis of the Range The range varies with the angle of projection. For any initial velocity \\( v_0 \\) , the optimal launch angle for the maximum range is 45\u00b0. We can observe the relationship between the range and angle through a graph. Changes in initial velocity \\( v_0 \\) and gravitational acceleration \\( g \\) also affect the range. Higher initial velocity or lower gravitational acceleration results in a longer range. 3. Practical Applications This model is applicable in real-world scenarios such as: - Sports (e.g., soccer, basketball), - Engineering (e.g., launching projectiles), - Space exploration (e.g., rocket trajectories). However, it assumes no air resistance and level ground, which limits its realism in some cases. 4. Code Implementation Below is the Python code used to simulate projectile motion and plot the range vs angle graph. ```python import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt Constants v_0 = 30 # Initial velocity in m/s g = 9.8 # Gravitational acceleration in m/s\u00b2 Range of angles angles = np.linspace(0, 90, 100) Calculate the range as a function of angle ranges = (v_0* 2 * np.sin(np.radians(2 angles))) / g Plot the range vs angle plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6)) plt.plot(angles, ranges) plt.title(\"Range vs. Angle of Projection\") plt.xlabel(\"Angle of Projection (degrees)\") plt.ylabel(\"Range (meters)\") plt.grid(True) Save the plot as an image plt.savefig(\"range_vs_angle.png\") Show the plot (optional) plt.show() 3. View the Plot in Markdown When you open the Markdown file (in a Markdown viewer or GitHub), you should see the graph embedded in the document. 4. Push to GitHub (If Needed) If you want to push the updated Markdown file and image to GitHub , follow these steps: Add the image and markdown file to Git : If the image ( range_vs_angle.png ) and your Markdown file are in the same folder, just add them to the repository.
